# Plan

- Definitions
- Types (semantics, representations, generated runtime code)
- Interoperability
- Usage

---
# __Definitions__

---
# AST interface

User builds type definition AST in Go.
_Syntax to come later, when the language matures._

<br>

```go
import "github.com/ipld/edelweiss/defs"

Types{
   Named{ Name: "MyLink", Type: Link{To: Int{}} }, // link to int
   Named{ Name: "MyList", Type: List{Element: Any{}} }, // list of any
   ...
}
```

---
# Named definitions

Wrap a type definition in `Named{}` 
<br>
```go
Named{
   Name: "MyStructure"
   Type: Structure{
      Fields: Fields{
         Field{ Name: "Foo", Type: Int{} },
         Field{ Name: "Bar", Type: Any{} },
      }
   }
}
```

---
# Inline definitions

```go
Named{
   Name: "MyStructure"
   Type: Structure{
      Fields: Fields{
         Field{
            Name: "MyFieldFoo",
            Type: List{Element: Int{}}, // <-- inline type definition, list of int
         },
      }
   }
}
```

Inline types are named generically, e.g. `AnonListXXX`

---
# Named inline definitions

```go
Named{
   Name: "MyStructure"
   Type: Structure{
      Fields: Fields{
         Field{
            Name: "MyFieldFoo",
            Type: Named { // <-- named inline type definition, list of int
               Name: "MyInlineListOfInt",
               Type: List{Element: Int{}},
            },
         },
      }
   }
}
```

---
# Type references

Use `Ref{Name: "TypeName"}` to refer to any `Named` type
<br>
```go
Named{
     Name: "MyList",
     Type: List{ Element: Int{} }
}

Named{
     Name: "MyListOfList",
     Type: List{ Element: Ref{Name: "MyList"} }
}
```

---
# __Types__

---
# Significance of types

1. Semantics of data (agnostic to programming language)
2. Representation of data in the IPLD Data Model (encoding/decoding)
   Note: _"Transforms" (introduced later) can alter representation._
3. Representation of data in the target programming language

---
# Types

- **Non-parametric**
  - **Builtin:** Bool, Float, Int, Byte, _Char_, _String_, _Bytes_
  - **Special:** Any, Nothing
- **Parametric**
  - **Composite:** Link, List, Map, Structure, _Inductive_, _Singleton_, _Union_
  - **Functional:** _Function_, _Service_, _Method_

_Italicized types_ are new or different from IPLD Schema types.

---
# __Non-parametric types__

---
# Builtin types

Definitions:
```go
Bool{} // represented as IPLD bool
Float{} // represented as IPLD float
Int{} // represented as IPLD int
Byte{} // represented as IPLD int
Char{}
String{}
Bytes{}
```
Runtime implementations in package `github.com/ipld/edelweiss/values`:
```go
type Byte byte
// etc.
```

---
# Char

**Semantically:**
- a character is not an integer

**Representationally:**
- encoded as an IPLD integer which is a valid UTF8

**Programmatically:**
- Implemented by `type Char rune` in package `edelweiss/values`

---
# String

**Semantically:**
- `String{}` is equivalent to `List{Element: Char{}}`

**Representationally:**
- Encodes to IPLD string
- Decodes from a UTF8 IPLD string or the IPLD encoding of `List{Element: Char{}}`

**Programmatically:**
- Implemented by `type String string` in package `edelweiss/values`

---
# Bytes

**Semantically:**
- `Bytes{}` is equivalent to `List{Element: Byte{}}`

**Representationally:**
- Encodes to IPLD bytes
- Decodes from IPLD bytes or the IPLD encoding of `List{Element: Byte{}}`

**Programmatically:**
- Implemented by `type Bytes []byte` in package `edelweiss/values`

---
# __Special types__

---
# Nothing

**Semantically:**
- `Nothing{}` holds no value

**Representationally:**
- Encodes as IPLD nothing

**Programmatically:**
- Implemented by `type Nothing struct{}`

E.g. use in conjunction with `Inductive` types to describe enumerations.
E.g. use in conjunction with `Union` types to describe optional values.

---
# Any

**Semantically:**
- `Any{}` can hold any IPLD value
- IPLD kinds are in one-to-one mapping with types in this type sytem:
  - IPLD bool, int, float, string, bytes map to `Bool{}`, `Int{}`, `Float{}`, `String{}`, `Bytes{}`
  - IPLD link maps to `Link{To: Any{}}`
  - IPLD list maps to `List{To: Any{}}`
  - IPLD map maps to `Map{Key: Any{}, Value: Any{}}`
  - IPLD nothing maps to `Nothing{}`

**Programmatically:**
- Implemented by `type Any struct{ Value }`  where `Value` is an interface

---
# __Parametric types__

---
# Link

**Semantically:**
- `Link{To: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF}`

**Representationally:**
- Encodes as IPLD link

**Programmatically:**
- Code-generated Go `struct` which holds a `Cid`

Use `Link{To: Any{}}` when the link target is of unknown type.

---
# List

**Semantically:**
- `List{Element: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF}`

**Representationally:**
- Encodes as IPLD list

**Programmatically:**
- Code-generated Go alias for a slice type

---
# Map

**Semantically:**
- `Map{Key: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF, Value: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF}`

**Representationally:**
- Encodes as IPLD list of key/value pairs or an IPLD map, if the key is a string

**Programmatically:**
- Code-generated Go slice of key/value pairs or a Go map, if the key is a string

---
# Structure

**Semantically:**
- A list of named and typed fields, written as
```go
Structure{
     Fields: Fields{
          Field{Name: "NAME", Type: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF},
          ...
     }
}
```

**Representationally:**
- Encodes as IPLD map

**Programmatically:**
- Code-generated Go `struct`

---
# Singletons

**Semantically:**
- A builtin value that always equals a given constant, written as
```go
SingletonBool{BOOL_VALUE}
SingletonInt{INT_VALUE}
SingletonByte{BYTE_VALUE}
SingletonChar{CHAR_VALUE}
SingletonFloat{FLOAT_VALUE}
SingletonString{STRING_VALUE}
```

**Representationally:**
- Encoded as the correspoding IPLD kind

**Programmatically:**
- Code-generated as an empty Go `struct`

---
# Inductive

**Semantically:**
- One of a list of name/value pairs _distinguished by their name_, written as
```go
Inductive{
     Cases: Cases{
          Case{Name: "NAME", Type: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF},
          ...
     }
}
```

**Representationally:**
- Encoded as an IPLD map, wrapping the case name and its value

**Programmatically:**
- Code-generated as a Go `struct` with one pointer field per case

_"Inductive" types correspond to IPLD Schema "union" types._

---
# Union

**Semantically:**
- One of a list of name/value pairs _distinguished by their value_, written as
```go
Union{
     Cases: Cases{
          Case{Name: "NAME", Type: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF},
          ...
     }
}
```

**Representationally:**
- Encoded as the value of the active case
- The union itself has _no representational footprint_

**Programmatically:**
- Code-generated as a Go `struct` with one pointer field per case

---
# Inductive â‰  Union

Note that inductive and union types are fundamentally different:
- Both types constitute cases that have a name and a value
- Inductive cases are distinguished by their names
- Union cases are distinguished by their values

---
# Enumeration = Union + Singleton

Traditional enumerations over any primitive type can be expressed as a union of singletons:

```go
Union{
     Cases: Cases{
          Case{Name: "Case1", Value: SingletonInt{1}}
          Case{Name: "Case2", Value: SingletonInt{2}}
          ...
     }
}
```

---
# String-valued enumeration = Inductive + Nothing

Traditional enumerations over strings can also be expressed as an inductive type with nothing values:

```go
Inductive{
     Cases: Cases{
          Case{Name: "Case1", Value: Nothing{}}
          Case{Name: "Case2", Value: Nothing{}}
          ...
     }
}
```

---
# **Services**


---
# Service type

- A _service_ is a collection of _methods_
- Each _method_ is uniquely named and associated with a _functional signature_
- A functional signature specifies the types of the argument and a return values

---
# Service definition

```go
Named{
     Name: "MyService"
     Service{
          Methods: Methods{
               Method{
                    Name: "MyMethod",
                    Type: Fn{
                         Arg: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF,
                         Return: TYPE_DEF_OR_REF,
                    },
               },
               ...
          },
     },
}
```

---
# Generated RPC code

- The compiler supports multiple RPC code-generation backends
- Currently, we have a DAGJSON-over-HTTP backend
  - Single URL endpoint per service
  - Method and arguments captured in the DAGJSON body of an HTTP GET request

---
# **Cross-version and -capability interoperability**

---
# Problem

- Protocols always evolve; never in a finished state
- It is hard to predict the direction of evolution of a protocol
- This causes over-thinking, over-engineering and paralisis in earlier version designs

# Solution

- Enable backwards-compatible growth from any state and in any part of a protocol

---
# Structures can grow

A server expecting
```go
Structure{
     Fields: Fields{
          Field{ Name: "Foo", Type: Int{} },
     },
}
```
Will accept requests from a client sending
```go
Structure{
     Fields: Fields{
          Field{ Name: "Foo", Type: Int{} },
          Field{ Name: "Bar", Type: String{} },
     },
}
```

---
# Structures can shrink

A server expecting
```go
Structure{
     Fields: Fields{
          Field{ Name: "Bar", Type: Union{
                    Cases: Cases{
                         Case{ Name: "Missing", Type: Nothing{} },
                         Case{ Name: "String", Type: String{} },
                    },
               },
          },
     },
}
```
Will accept requests from a client sending
```go
Structure{ Fields: Fields{} }
```
_This feature is slated for Milestone 2._

---
# Introducing alternatives where there weren't (1/2)

Suppose V1 of a type definition is:
```go
Structure{
     Fields: Fields{
          Field{
               Name: "Foo",
               Type: Int{},
          },
     },
}
```

---
# Introducing alternatives where there weren't (2/2)

The next iteration, V2, of the protocol can substitute any given type with a union over old and new alternatives:
```go
Structure{
     Fields: Fields{
          Field{
               Name: "Foo",
               Type: Union{   // int is substituted by union of int or float
                    Cases: Cases{
                         Case{ Name: "MyInt", Type: Int{} },
                         Case{ Name: "MyFloat", Type: Float{} },
                    }
               },
          },
     },
}
```

---
# Excess, deficit and unexpected data

At a receiver:

- Data which is in excess of the schema can be captured generically as IPLD data. This applies to: structure fields and union/inductive cases.

- Data which is missing can be captured, by instructing the code-generator to treat the entire schema as optional (at every level of the schema hierarchy)

- Data which contradicts the expected types can also be captured generically as IPLD data. This applies to: structure fields and union/inductive cases.

_These features are planned for Milestone 2, based on use case urgency._

---
# **Usage**
---
# Compiling and code generation

_See a complete example in github.com/ipld/edelweiss/examples_

Compile type definitions to a Go source file generation plan:
```go
x := &GoPkgCodegen{
     GoPkgDirPath: "/home/petar/src/foo/bar", // local directory for generated code
     GoPkgPath:    "github.com/petar/foo/bar", // go package name of generated code
     Defs:         Types{ ... }, // type definitions
}
goFile, err := x.Compile()
```

Materialize the Go file to disk:
```go
err = goFile.Build()
```
